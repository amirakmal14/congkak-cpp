| How to play  |
+--------------+
1. Scoop up all of the shells or seeds in any house on your side. Then drop a shell into the next house and continue depositing one shell into every house in a clockwise fashion. You should also drop a shell into your storehouse each time you pass it, but do not deposit any shells into your opponent's storehouse.

2. Take another turn if you deposit your last shell into your own storehouse. If the last shell that you deposit falls into your own storehouse, then you get to take another turn. In this case, you may scoop up the shells from another of your houses and deposit them into other houses.

3. Skip a turn if you deposit your last shell into one of your opponent∩┐╜s empty storehouses. Empty storehouses on your opponent's side of the board will create an obstacle for you. During a turn, if you drop your last shell into one of your opponent∩┐╜s empty houses, then you lose a turn

4. Collect your opponent's shells if you deposit your last shell into one of your own empty storehouses. The goal of Congkak is to have the most shells in your storehouse at the end of the game. During a turn, if you manage to drop your last shell into an empty house on your side of the board, then you get to collect the shells that are opposite that house.

5. Count up the shells in your storehouse. After you and your opponent have both emptied your houses, the game is over. To determine a winner, count up the shells in your storehouse. Whoever has the most shells is the winner!

Notes :) *Try your best to avoid your opponent's empty houses so that you do not lose any turns.Take the shells from the corresponding house on your opponent's side of the board and put them into your storehouse.*
